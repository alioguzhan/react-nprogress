# Migrating

## v4.0.0

Allows multiple instances of `react-nprogress` on a page. Technically this isn't a breaking change, but it was decided to bump the major version in order to reduce the chance of bugs slipping into consuming code.

## v3.0.0

The source code was refactored to use [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). A `useNProgress` hook was also exposed. As a result, the `react` and `react-dom` peer dependency requirements are now `^16.8.0`.

## v2.0.0

The build process was refactored in this version. Technically this isn't a breaking change, but it was decided to bump the major version in order to reduce the chance of bugs slipping into consuming code.
